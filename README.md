# Coinmarketcap

CoinMarketcap is a price tracking site and crypto data provider. It publishes real-time crypto assets and market data, including price tracking, crypto asset market capitalization, and cryptocurrency exchange volume data.

If you have some crypto investments, you probably bought them from a few sources: perhaps you bought BTC from Coinbase, bought BNB from Binance, and then maybe bought many other coins or tokens from different exchanges.

It is always hard to keep track of all the coins or tokens you have when they are all over the place, or you just simply cannot remember how much you own and where you put them!

CoinMarketCap has a Portfolio tool that allows you to input your crypto investment records, similar to providing you a nice bookkeeping tool to keep all your investments in one place. The site helps you analyze the value of your investment, profit and loss!

=================================

To create a crypto portfolio you need to register on the website (enter any non-existent email and password more than 6 characters).

The site is hosted on hosting firebase:
